# Titanic-survival-predictor

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values. 

In this code I have used a linear model to predict the survival rate of passangers from the titanic dataset.

*This section is based on the following documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear*

'''In last we'll have a model with a 74% accuracy (this will change each time)! Not crazy impressive but decent for our first try.'''
'''We can actually use this model to make predicitons.'''

'''We can use the .predict() method to get survival probabilities from the model. This method will return a list of dicts that store a predicition for each of the entries in our testing data set.'''

As you can see the survival rate is not very high :/
